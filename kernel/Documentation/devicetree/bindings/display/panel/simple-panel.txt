Simple display panel
====================

panel node
----------

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
	- "simple-panel": for common simple panel
	- "simple-panel-dsi": for common simple dsi panel
	- "vendor,panel": for vendor specific panel
- power-supply: See panel-common.txt

Optional properties:
- vsp-supply: positive voltage supply
- vsn-supply: negative voltage supply
- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle of an I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable or disable the panel
- reset-gpios: GPIO pin to reset the panel
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
- prepare-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel to
		    become ready and start receiving video data
- enable-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel to
		   display the first valid frame after starting to receive
		   video data
- disable-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel to
		    turn the display off (no content is visible)
- unprepare-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel
		      to power itself down completely
- reset-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel to
		  reset itself completely
- init-delay-ms: the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the panel to
		 send init command sequence after reset deassert
- width-mm: width (in millimeters) of the panel's active display area
- height-mm: height (in millimeters) of the panel's active display area
- bpc: bits per color/component
- bus-format: Pixel data format on the wire

- dsi,lanes: number of active data lanes
- dsi,format: pixel format for video mode
- dsi,flags: DSI operation mode related flags
- panel-init-sequence:
- panel-exit-sequence:
  A byte stream formed by simple multiple dcs packets.
	byte 0: dcs data type
	byte 1: wait number of specified ms after dcs command transmitted
	byte 2: packet payload length
	byte 3 and beyond: number byte of payload

- power-invert: power invert control
- rockchip,cmd-type: default is DSI cmd, or "spi", "mcu" cmd type
- spi-sdi: spi init panel for spi-sdi io
- spi-scl: spi init panel for spi-scl io
- spi-cs: spi init pael for spi-cs io

Example:

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "cptt,claa101wb01";
		ddc-i2c-bus = <&panelddc>;

		power-supply = <&vdd_pnl_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpio 90 0>;

		backlight = <&backlight>;
	};
