* Rockchip PDM controller

Required properties:

- compatible:
  - "rockchip,px30-pdm"
  - "rockchip,rk1808-pdm"
  - "rockchip,rk3308-pdm"
  - "rockchip,rk3328-pdm"
  - "rockchip,rk3568-pdm"
  - "rockchip,rv1126-pdm"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- dmas: DMA specifiers for rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: should include "rx".
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain following:
   - "pdm_hclk": clock for PDM BUS
   - "pdm_clk" : clock for PDM controller
- resets: a list of phandle + reset-specifer paris, one for each entry in reset-names.
- reset-names: reset names, should include "pdm-m".
- rockchip,no-dmaengine: This is a boolean property. If present, driver will do not
  register pcm dmaengine, only just register dai. if the dai is part of multi-dais,
  the property should be present. Please refer to rockchip,multidais.txt about
  multi-dais usage.
- pinctrl-names: Must contain a "default" entry.
- pinctrl-N: One property must exist for each entry in
	     pinctrl-names. See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
	     for details of the property values.

Optional properties:
- rockchip,path-map: This is a variable length array, that shows the mapping
  of SDIx to PATHx. By default, they are one-to-one mapping as follows:

   path0 <-- sdi0
   path1 <-- sdi1
   path2 <-- sdi2
   path3 <-- sdi3

  e.g. "rockchip,path-map = <3 2 1 0>" means the mapping as follows:

   path0 <-- sdi3
   path1 <-- sdi2
   path2 <-- sdi1
   path3 <-- sdi0

- rockchip,mclk-calibrate: This is a boolean value, if present, enable
  clk calibrate and compenation.

  note: the corresponding property 'pdm_clk_root' should be assigned.

Example for rk3328 PDM controller:

pdm: pdm@ff040000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,pdm";
	reg = <0x0 0xff040000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&clk_pdm>, <&clk_gates28 0>;
	clock-names = "pdm_clk", "pdm_hclk";
	dmas = <&pdma 16>;
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	dma-names = "rx";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pdmm0_clk
		     &pdmm0_sdi0
		     &pdmm0_sdi1
		     &pdmm0_sdi2
		     &pdmm0_sdi3>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&pdmm0_clk_sleep
		     &pdmm0_sdi0_sleep
		     &pdmm0_sdi1_sleep
		     &pdmm0_sdi2_sleep
		     &pdmm0_sdi3_sleep>;
};

Example for RV1126 PDM controller with mclk-calibrate:

&pdm {
	status = "okay";
	clocks = <&cru MCLK_PDM>, <&cru HCLK_PDM>, <&cru PLL_CPLL>;
	clock-names = "pdm_clk", "pdm_hclk", "pdm_clk_root";
	rockchip,mclk-calibrate;
};
