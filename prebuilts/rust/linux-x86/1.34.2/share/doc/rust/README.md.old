# Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles your project.

## Installing Cargo

Cargo is distributed by default with Rust, so if you've got `rustc` installed
locally you probably also have `cargo` installed locally.

## Compiling from Source

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `git`
* `python`
* `curl` (on Unix)
* OpenSSL headers (only for Unix, this is the `libssl-dev` package on ubuntu)
* `cargo` and `rustc`

First, you'll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

## Releases

High level release notes are available as part of [Rust's release notes][rel].
