// and each time a new file is added to the directory.
//
// If the callback returns a status other than ZX_OK, watching
// stops and the callback's status is returned to the caller

// If the deadline expires, ZX_ERR_TIMED_OUT is returned to the
// caller.  A deadline of ZX_TIME_INFINITE will never expire.
//
// The callback may use ZX_ERR_STOP as a way to signal to the
// caller that it wants to stop because it found what it was
// looking for, etc -- since this error code is not returned
// by syscalls or public APIs, the callback does not need to
// worry about it turning up normally.
