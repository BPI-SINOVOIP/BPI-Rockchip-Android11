Regression test for b/152199517

We would incorrectly search all declared methods of a class for interface
implementations instead of restricting ourselves to virtual methods when
looking for overrides to a superclasses interfaces. This could cause
exceptions and incorrect behavior as we might try to use a private or a
static method as an interface implementation.
