        This is used by the connectivity manager to decide which networks can coexist
        based on the hardware.

        ATV SDK is not designed to have all networks available on handheld devices.
        To date only specific networks (e.g. "mobile,0,..") are removed from defaults
        to comply with CTS, others are still kept for different compatibilities.

        See format details here: frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml.
