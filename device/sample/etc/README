===== apns-full-conf.xml =====

This file contains apn configurations and serves as a sample file.
A typical APN config looks like this:
<apn carrier="CarrierXYZ"
      carrier_id="1"
      mcc="123"
      mnc="123"
      apn="carrierxyz"
      type="default,supl,mms,ims,cbs"
      mmsc="http://mms.carrierxyz.com"
      mmsproxy="0.0.0.0"
      mmsport="80"
      bearer_bitmask="4|5|6|7|8|12"
/>

For APNs with a matching carrier ID please assign a carrier ID
