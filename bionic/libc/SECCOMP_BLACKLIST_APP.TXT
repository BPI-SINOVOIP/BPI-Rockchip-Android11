# This file is used to populate seccomp's whitelist policy in combination with SYSCALLS.TXT.
# Note that the resultant policy is applied only to zygote spawned processes.
#
# The final seccomp whitelist is SYSCALLS.TXT - SECCOMP_BLACKLIST.TXT + SECCOMP_WHITELIST.TXT
# Any entry in the blacklist must be in the syscalls file and not be in the whitelist file
#
# This file is processed by a python script named genseccomp.py.

# Note: Some privileged syscalls are still needed in app process after fork before uid change,
# including capset and setresuid. This is because the seccomp filter must be installed while
# the process still has CAP_SYS_ADMIN; changing the uid would remove that capability.
