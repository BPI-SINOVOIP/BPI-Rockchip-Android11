# Telephony information related to time zone detection.
#
# This is a proto file in text format.
#
# The file is used to generate the on-device file used when picking
# a time zone for an Android device.

# networks:
#
# A set of networks which use an MCC+MNC combination but *do not* actually
# operate in the country the MCC would suggest and therefore cause problems when
# MCC is used for country detection. There is no need to enter networks that
# operate in the country linked to the MCC. MCC+MNC combinations that operate
# in multiple countries where the MCC country is one of them must also not be
# entered here.
#
# The ordering of network elements is not important but is kept in ASCII
# order by MCC and MNC, then country ISO code for easier maintenance.
# There must only be one network element per MCC+MNC combination.

# Network:
#
# mcc:
# The Mobile Country Code.
#
# mnc:
# The Mobile Network Code.
#
# countryIsoCode:
# The (lower cased) ISO 3166 2-character country code. Must be a known valid code.
