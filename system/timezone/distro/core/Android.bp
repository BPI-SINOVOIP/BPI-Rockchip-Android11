// Library of classes for handling time zone distros. Used on-device for
// handling distros and within CTS tests.
//
// This is distinct from time_zone_distro_unbundled. It should be used
// for platform code as it avoids circular dependencies when stubs targets
// need to build framework (as appears to be the case in aosp/master).
// Also used from host-side tests and tools.
