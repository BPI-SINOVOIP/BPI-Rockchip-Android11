# Contributing to CHRE

It is encouraged that vendors implementing CHRE for their platforms contribute
their code back to the open source project when possible as this will help
provide more reference code for others and give the CHRE team better insight
into the various use cases of users of the project.

Anyone can upload patches to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and have
the CHRE team review them using [these
instructions](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/submit-patches).
