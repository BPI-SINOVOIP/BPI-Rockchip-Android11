README
------

1. Pulling the latest TFLM code base:  ../../external/tflm/tflm_sync_srcs.sh

2. Make modifications to the nanoapp accordingly. If you have new source files,
please add them to `COMMON_SRCS` in the Makefile.

Also TFLM uses its own flatbuffer version not the default one in CHRE. Please be
aware of this when developping nanoapps using flatbuffer.

3. Build nanoapp for your platform, e.g. make google_hexagonv66_slpi-see-uimg
