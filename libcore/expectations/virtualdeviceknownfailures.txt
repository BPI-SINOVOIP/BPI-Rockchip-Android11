/*
 * List of test cases known to fail on a virtual device.
 *
 * Many are because of the network environment used by some or all of the
 * virtual devices during CTS runs.
 *
 * See: https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc
 * As of 2019-05: "VPC networks only support IPv4 unicast traffic. They do not
 * support broadcast, multicast, or IPv6 traffic within the network: VMs in the
 * VPC network can only send to IPv4 destinations and only receive traffic from
 * IPv4 sources.
