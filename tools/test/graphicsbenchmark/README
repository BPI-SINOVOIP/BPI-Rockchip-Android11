Build
-----
Note: env setup requires slightly more than a normal Android build,
so that the path gets adjusted for tradefed.sh:

From the root of your Android tree:

$ . build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch 2				# generic aosp arm64 eng build
$ mmma tools/tradefederation/core tools/test/graphicsbenchmark

To run, ensure that `adb` and `aapt` are available on your path, and run from tools/test/graphicsbenchmark dir:

$ tradefed.sh run commandAndExit AndroidTest.xml

Available options include:
--apk-info  An XML file describing the list of APKs for qualifications.
--apk-dir   Directory contains the APKs for qualifications.  If --apk-info is not specified and a
file named 'apk-info.xml' exists in --apk-dir, that file will be used as the apk-info.

Contact a member of the team for alternative test apks.

gamecore.zip
------------
To create a gamecore.zip for distribution, run:
$ tapas gamecore && make dist DIST_DIR=dist

This will create a gamecore.zip in the 'dist' directory.

Testing
-------
To run unit tests:
$ atest --include-subdirs --test-mapping tools/test/graphicsbenchmark:presubmit
