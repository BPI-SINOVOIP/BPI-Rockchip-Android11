# Trade Federation Test Framework

This is the top-layer provided to write and run tests against.

The goal of this layer is to provide a simple framework to
write and execute tests.

This directory should contain classes that are:
* Related to tests (IRemoteTest types)
* Related to tests setup (ITargetPreparer types)
* Related to metrics collection during tests (IMetricCollector types)
* Utilities specific to the tests, preparers or collectors
