     * is supported.
     *

     * is not changed.
     *
     * Optionally, caching information may be provided for the driver to save
     * the prepared model to cache files for faster model compilation time
     * when the same model preparation is requested in the future. There are
     * two types of cache file handles provided to the driver: model cache
     * and data cache. For more information on the two types of cache handles,
     * refer to getNumberOfCacheFilesNeeded.
     *
     * The file descriptors must be opened with read and write permission. A file may
     * have any size, and the corresponding file descriptor may have any offset. The
     * driver must truncate a file to zero size before writing to that file. The file
     * descriptors may be closed by the client once the asynchronous preparation has
     * finished. The driver must dup a file descriptor if it wants to get access to
     * the cache file later.
     *
     * The model is prepared asynchronously with respect to the caller. The
     * prepareModel function must verify the inputs to the preparedModel function
     * related to preparing the model (as opposed to saving the prepared model to
     * cache) are correct. If there is an error, prepareModel must immediately invoke
     * the callback with the appropriate ErrorStatus value and nullptr for the
     * IPreparedModel, then return with the same ErrorStatus. If the inputs to the
     * prepareModel function that are related to preparing the model are valid and
     * there is no error, prepareModel must launch an asynchronous task
     * to prepare the model in the background, and immediately return from
     * prepareModel with ErrorStatus::NONE. If the asynchronous task fails to launch,
     * prepareModel must immediately invoke the callback with
     * ErrorStatus::GENERAL_FAILURE and nullptr for the IPreparedModel, then return

     *
     * When the asynchronous task has finished preparing the model, it must

     * prepareModel. If the model was prepared successfully, the callback object
     * must be invoked with an error status of ErrorStatus::NONE and the
     * produced IPreparedModel object. If an error occurred preparing the model,
     * the callback object must be invoked with the appropriate ErrorStatus
     * value and nullptr for the IPreparedModel.
     *
     * Optionally, the driver may save the prepared model to cache during the
     * asynchronous preparation. Any error that occurs when saving to cache must
     * not affect the status of preparing the model. Even if the input arguments
     * related to the cache may be invalid, or the driver may fail to save to cache,
