This directory contains a modified version of the default implementation
provided for sensors HAL 2.0 to support multi-HAL 2.0. It should be used as a
means to verify the multi-HAL 2.0 implementation can successfully load and
interact with sub-HALs.

This sub-HAL implementation has two macros that can be used to configure support
for different sets of sensors. One "SUPPORT_CONTINUOUS_SENSORS", enables
support for continuous sensors like accel, and gyro whereas the other
"SUPPORT_ON_CHANGE_SENSORS" enables support for on change sensors like the
light and proximity sensor. A build target is defined for each of these macros,
but more targets could be added to support both in one sub-HAL or none at all,
if necessary.

When built, the library will be written to
out/target/product/<device>/vendor/lib64/android.hardware.sensors@2.0-fakesubhal.so

Take this .so and place it where the multi-HAL config will cause the HalProxy to
look and then restart the system server with adb shell stop / adb shell start
to cause the multi-HAL to restart and attempt to load in the sub-HAL.
