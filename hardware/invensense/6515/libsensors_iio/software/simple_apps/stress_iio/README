Usage of inv_stress_iio:

> inv_stress_iio: 
  this will run enable and disable sequence sequentially. 
  In the enable sequence, this will enable all the engines, output, and all dmp
  events. 
  In the disable sequence, this will disable all but accel engine; all outputs 
  are disabled, only events are allowed.

> inv_stress_iio -e 10 -d 1: 
  this set the enable sequence to 10 seconds and disable sequence for 1 seconds.

> inv_stress_iio -c: 
  this includes the compass in the enable sequence when you have 9150 or other
  secondary bus compass. It won't work for compasses on the primary bus.

> inv_stress_iio -r: 
  this set the enable and disable sequences to last a random time. It is good 
  for stress test.

> inv_stress_iio -m: 
  this enables motion interrupt during the disable sequence. 
  When this is enabled, the driver enters low power accel mode and disables all 
  other sensor output (including quaternion, gyro, accel, and compass.) in the 
  disabled sequence:
