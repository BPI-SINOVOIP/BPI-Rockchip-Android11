 * \brief Copies record data from the makernote to given buffer.

 * The amount to copy depends on size value given as input in the record header structure. If size is 0,
 * only the record header is updated with correct data size and no data is copied. Thus this function can be called twice:
 * First to get the record size and second time (after allocating a buffer for the output) to get the record data. When querying
 * for record, DFID and DNID must match the record's DFID and DNID.
 * Note. Makernote data CRC validity is not checked when getting records. Prior to calling this function,
