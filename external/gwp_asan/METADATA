description:
    "GWP-ASan is a sampled allocator framework that assists in finding "
    "use-after-free and heap-buffer-overflow bugs in production environments. "
    "It informally is a recursive acronym, 'GWP-ASan Will Provide Allocation "
    "SANity'. "
    "GWP-ASan is based on the classic Electric Fence Malloc Debugger "
    "<https://linux.die.net/man/3/efence>, with a key adaptation. Notably, we "
    "only choose a very small percentage of allocations to sample, and apply "
    "guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling is small "
    "enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead."
