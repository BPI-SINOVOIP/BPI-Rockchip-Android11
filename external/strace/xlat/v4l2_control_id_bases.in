/*
 * Linux kernel commit v4.18-rc2-106-g421860b9d47053badce4b247576fa48df9ab4c48
 * has changed the value of V4L2_CID_USER_IMX_BASE constant introduced
 * by commit v4.13-rc1~141^2~121 because the old value was already used
 * by V4L2_CID_USER_MAX217X_BASE.
 * This is of course an ABI breakage that affects Linux kernels starting
 * with 4.13 and up to 4.18, as well as their LTS derivatives.
 * Since the imx driver didn't provide any public control ID definitions,
 * it looks like the best way to handle this situation is to pretend that
 * the old value of V4L2_CID_USER_IMX_BASE didn't exist.
