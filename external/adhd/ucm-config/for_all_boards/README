Regarding the two dead sym links WD15 Dock and WD19 Dock

ALSA has added a ucm for the ucm the sym links they point to and the ucm
has been patched in the chromiumos overlay. Unfortunately the alsa-lib
installs via Makefile and make HATES files with spaces, so we are keeping
the sym links here (even though they appear dead) they are NOT. Once
deployed with alsa-lib 1.1.8 they will have a proper target on a dut.
