description:
    "Lato means “Summer” in Polish, and it is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic."
    "Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different stylistic direction."
