Local Modifications:
The character corresponding to U+2600 was removed using fonttools (https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) to comply with Android font requirements.
A Python script was created that used fonttools Subsetter oobject to create a copy of the font with a subset including all characters but U+2600.
