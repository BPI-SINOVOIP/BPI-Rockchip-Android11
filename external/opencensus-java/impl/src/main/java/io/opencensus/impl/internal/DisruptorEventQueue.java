/**
 * A low-latency event queue for background updating of (possibly contended) objects. This is
 * intended for use by instrumentation methods to ensure that they do not block foreground
 * activities. To customize the action taken on reading the queue, derive a new class from {@link
 * EventQueue.Entry} and pass it to the {@link #enqueue(Entry)} method. The {@link Entry#process()}
 * method of your class will be called and executed in a background thread. This class is a
 * Singleton.
 *
 * <p>Example Usage: Given a class as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class someClass {
 *   public void doSomething() {
 *     // Do the work of the method. One result is a measurement of something.
 *     int measurement = doSomeWork();
 *     // Make an update to the class state, based on this measurement. This work can take some
 *     // time, but can be done asynchronously, in the background.
 *     update(measurement);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void update(int arg) {
 *     // do something
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The work of calling {@code someClass.update()} can be executed in the backgound as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class someClass {
 *   // Add a EventQueueEntry class that will process the update call.
 *   private static final class SomeClassUpdateEvent implements EventQueueEntry {
 *     private final SomeClass someClassInstance;
 *     private final int arg;
 *
 *     SomeObjectUpdateEvent(SomeObject someClassInstance, int arg) {
 *       this.someClassInstance = someClassInstance;
 *       this.arg = arg;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void process() {
 *       someClassInstance.update(arg);
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void doSomething() {
 *     int measurement = doSomeWork();
 *     // Instead of calling update() directly, create an event to do the processing, and insert
 *     // it into the EventQueue. It will be processed in a background thread, and doSomething()
 *     // can return immediately.
 *     EventQueue.getInstance.enqueue(new SomeClassUpdateEvent(this, measurement));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
