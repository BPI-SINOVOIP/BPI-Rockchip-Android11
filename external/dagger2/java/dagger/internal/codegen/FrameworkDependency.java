/**
 * The framework class and binding key for a resolved dependency of a binding. If a binding has
 * several dependencies for a key, then only one instance of this class will represent them all.
 *
 * <p>In the following example, the binding {@code provideFoo()} has two dependency requests:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code Bar bar}
 *   <li>{@code Provider<Bar> barProvider}
 * </ol>
 *
 * But they both can be satisfied with the same instance of {@code Provider<Bar>}. So one instance
 * of {@code FrameworkDependency} will be used for both. Its {@link #key()} will be for {@code Bar},
 * and its {@link #frameworkType()} will be {@link FrameworkType#PROVIDER}.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *   {@literal @Provides} static Foo provideFoo(Bar bar, {@literal Provider<Bar>} barProvider) {
 *     return new Foo(â€¦);
 *   }
 * </code></pre>
