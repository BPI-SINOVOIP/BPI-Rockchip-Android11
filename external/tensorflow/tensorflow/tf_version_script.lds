    # Though it may seem unsafe to export grpc, any .so files that rely on gRPC
    # MUST do it through tensorflow's version, because gRPC uses link-time
    # object registration, and if they hard link their own gRPC dependencies
    # then at load time you get a segfault due to registration collissions.
    # As a result, any dynamic libraries relying on gRPC must build with gRPC
    # deps in header-only mode, and rely on tensorflow's symbol exports at
    # link-time.
