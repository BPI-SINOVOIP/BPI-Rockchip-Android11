Local modifications:
- Copy public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Removed build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.bp

The Android.bp file creates WebP decoder and encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by adding libwebp-decode and libwebp-encode to
'static_libs'.
