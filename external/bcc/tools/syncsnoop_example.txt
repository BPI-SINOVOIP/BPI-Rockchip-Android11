Demonstrations of syncsnoop, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This program traces calls to the kernel sync() routine, with basic timestamps:

# ./syncsnoop
TIME(s)            CALL
16458148.611952    sync()
16458151.533709    sync()
^C

While tracing, the "sync" command was executed in another server session.

This can be useful to identify that sync() is being called, and its frequency.
