Demonstrations of bashreadline, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This prints bash commands from all running bash shells on the system. For
example:

# ./bashreadline
TIME      PID    COMMAND
05:28:25  21176  ls -l
05:28:28  21176  date
05:28:35  21176  echo hello world
05:28:43  21176  foo this command failed
05:28:45  21176  df -h
05:29:04  3059   echo another shell
05:29:13  21176  echo first shell again

The entered command may fail. This is just showing what command lines were
entered interactively for bash to process.

It works by tracing the return of the readline() function using uprobes
(specifically a uretprobe).
