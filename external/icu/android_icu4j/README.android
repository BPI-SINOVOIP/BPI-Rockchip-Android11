Except where noted, source code in this directory is generated by tools beneath
external/icu/tools/srcgen. Do not modify the code here. Instead, modify the
transformation rules used to generate it.

The source is compiled into core-icu4j alongside the resources. See the
libcore/JavaLibrary.bp build rules for details.
