description:
    "Header-only library for division via fixed-point multiplication by inverse "
    " "
    "On modern CPUs and GPUs integer division is several times slower than "
    "multiplication. FXdiv implements an algorithm to replace an integer "
    "division with a multiplication and two shifts. This algorithm improves "
    "performance when an application performs repeated divisions by the same "
    "divisor."
