This is the faft_pd test suite. The tests in this suites verify the behaviors
of the USB PD stack, like establishing a PD contract, hard and soft resets,
data role swap, power role swap, VBUS voltage negotiation, etc.

This suite only tests a single Type-C port connecting to the PDTester device
(Plankton or Servo v4). For DUT with multiple Type-C ports, should run this
suite multiple time for all the Type-C ports.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
