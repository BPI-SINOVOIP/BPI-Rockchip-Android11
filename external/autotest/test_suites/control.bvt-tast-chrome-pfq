DOC = """
This suite verifies Chrome's basic functionality for the Chrome Pre-Flight Queue
by running all Chrome and ARC (since ARC depends on Chrome) Tast integration
tests that must always pass against a DUT. See http://go/tast for more
information about Tast.

The only Autotest tests executed by this suite are tast.critical-chrome and
tast.critical-android, which are server tests that execute the tast executable.
The tast executable runs individual Tast tests. If any of these Tast tests fail,
then the corresponding tast.critical test (and this suite) fail.
