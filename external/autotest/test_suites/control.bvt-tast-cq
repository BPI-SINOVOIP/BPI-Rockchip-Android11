This suite verifies Chrome OS's basic functionality for the Chrome OS Commit
Queue by running all Tast integration tests (exercising ARC, Chrome, and the OS
itself) that must always pass against a DUT. See http://go/tast for more
information about Tast.

The only Autotest tests executed by this suite are tast.critical-*, which are
server tests that execute the tast executable. The tast executable runs
individual Tast tests. If any of these Tast tests fail, then the corresponding
tast.critical test (and this suite) fail.
