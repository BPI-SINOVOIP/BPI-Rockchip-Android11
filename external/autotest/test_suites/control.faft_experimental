This is the faft_experimental test suite, for AP (BIOS) and EC firmware.

This suite is meant to be a proving ground for AP/EC firmware tests before they
are promoted to the actual faft_bios / faft_ec suites.  Flaky tests should also
be moved here while they're being worked on.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
