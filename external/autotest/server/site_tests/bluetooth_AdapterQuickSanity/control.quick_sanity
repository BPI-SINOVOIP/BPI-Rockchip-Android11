    This class implements a Bluetooth quick sanity package, using
    methods provided in BluetoothAdapterQuickTests,
    The package is running several sub batches of tests.
    A batch is defined as a set of tests, preferably with a common subject, e.g
    'LE Sanity' batch.
    The quick sanity test pacakge is imporving test time by doing the minimal
    cleanups between each test and test batches, saving the auto-test ramp up
    time of about 90-120 second per test.
