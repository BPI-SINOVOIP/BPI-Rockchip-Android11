Verify the console can be opened while the AP is off.

Test the case where the AP is off and the case when cr50 has reset while the
AP is off.

This must be done using servo instead of CCD, because we need to be able to
be able to recover the DUT when cr50 is in a bad state.

This test is applicable when using ToT cr50 module.
TODO(crbug.com/1014572) Drop this control file once suites can inject test args.
