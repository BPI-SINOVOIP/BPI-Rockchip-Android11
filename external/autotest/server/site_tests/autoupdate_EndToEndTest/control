This is an end-to-end update test of Chrome OS releases. Given a test
configuration, it will perform an end-to-end test of a Chrome OS update
payload. A test configuration can be given as command-line arguments (see
below) or instantiated inline as local varibles.

To invoke this test locally:

  test_that <DUT-IPADDR> autoupdate_EndToEndTest --args="<ARGLIST>"

where ARGLIST is a whitespace separated list of the following key=value pairs.
Values pertaining to the test case include:

  name=TAG           name tag for the test (e.g. 'nmo', 'npo' or 'fsi')
  update_type=full|delta  type of update being applied, either 'full' or 'delta'
  source_release=REL      source image release version (e.g. 2672.0.0)
  target_release=REL      target image release version (e.g. 2673.0.0)
  source_payload_uri=URI  URI of the source full payload. None means don't
                          install a source image (assume it's preinstalled).
  source_archive_uri=URI  (optional) URI of where the artifacts for the source
                          image (e.g.  stateful update) are located. If not
                          provided, the test will attempt using the same
                          location as source_payload_uri.  This is required for
                          any test where the location of the full (source)
                          payload is separate from that of its build artifacts
                          (e.g. it is in gs://chromeos-releases/).
  target_payload_uri=URI  URI of the target payload
  target_archive_uri=URI  (optional) URI of where the artifacts for the target
                          image (e.g. stateful update) are located. If not
                          provided, the test will attempt using the test job's
                          repo ID (if present), otherwise default to the same
                          location as target_payload_uri.  Normally, this is
                          only needed for local (non-AFE) runs where the
                          payload location is separate from that of the build
                          artifacts (e.g. it is in gs://chromeos-releases).


To run locally:
1. Find the Google Storage URIs of the images you want to use during the test.
    You can choose payloads from this bucket: gs://chromeos-releases/
    (https://pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser/chromeos-releases/)

    Sample from gs://chromeos-releases:
      gs://chromeos-releases/dev-channel/samus/9433.0.0/payloads/chromeos_9433.0
      .0_samus_dev-channel_full_test.bin-1e2db02f3bd9d9ebe74dc81fc7038919

2. Choose the devserver you want to use.
    This test uses a devserver to control the autoupdate. You can point to a
    devserver on your workstation to aid debugging or you can choose to use a
    devserver in the lab.

    To start your own devserver, run this (outside the chroot):
    src/platform/dev/devserver.py --port=8084

    For a devserver running on your workstation use 127.0.0.1 as the hostname.
    For a devserver running in the lab the port is usually 8082.

    Add this line to src/third_party/autotest/files/shadow_config.ini in the [CROS] section:
    dev_server = http://<hostname>:<port>
    (If shadow_config.ini doesn't exist, you can create it, add [CROS], and add the above.)

    The devserver needs to be able to reach the DUT you choose in the next
    section. Use this instruction to find the list of lab devservers:
        atest server list | grep devserver

3. Choose the DUT you want to use for the test.
   You can use a DUT on your desk connected to corp or you can lock a DUT
   in the lab for use in the test.

4. Setup ssh correctly.
    You will need to setup a number of ssh keys and then copy them to
    your chroot so that you can ssh into a devserver from there.

    Run ssh-keygen to generate your id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files into ~/.ssh/

    Download the testing_rsa ssh keys from here:
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/chromite/+/master/ssh_keys
    Save both to ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/testing_rsa* (otherwise permissions are too loose and
    will be ignored)

    Add these lines to your ~/.ssh/config
    Host *.cros
      User root
      IdentityFile /usr/local/google/home/<your ldap here>/.ssh/testing_rsa

    You should now be able to ssh into DUTs in the lab without a password.

    Follow these instructions to setup the ssh access to lab devservers:
    https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/chromeos/for-team-members/infrastructure/chromeos-admin/devserver-access
        You'll need appropriate group membership to be able to access the
        Valentine secret for the devserver file.

    Get access to "Access To Chrome Lab or Cautotest" from:
    https://sphinx.corp.google.com/sphinx/#accessChangeRequest:systemName=default-mnp-use-cases

    Check that you can now ssh into a lab devserver without a password.

    Finally and most importantly, copy the ssh files to your chroot's .ssh
    folder so you can ssh from there:
      cp -a ~/.ssh/. ~/chromiumos/chroot/home/${USER}/.ssh/

5. Make sure you have your gsutil permissions (your .boto file).
    Your .boto file must be available inside the chroot.
    cp ~/.boto chroot/home/<user>/

    Make sure the gsutil command is available outside the chroot (note:
    the gsutil package in Ubuntu is not what you're looking for.)

6. Kick off the test with test_that from a chroot. e.g
      test_that <IP OF DUT> autoupdate_EndToEndTest
      --args="target_release=10906.0.0
      source_payload_uri='gs://chromeos-releases/canary-channel/nami/10760.0
      .0/payloads/chromeos_10760.0.0_nami_canary-channel_full_test
      .bin-cee25d306d164f7514e26efb34f8f57d'
      target_payload_uri='gs://chromeos-releases/canary-channel/nami/10906.0
      .0/payloads/chromeos_10760.0.0-10906.0.0_nami_canary-channel_delta_test
      .bin-98f9af8d919605fc3ee1391eaa79c7e6'
      source_release=10760.0.0 update_type=delta"

7. Unlock any DUTs you locked for debugging when you are done.
