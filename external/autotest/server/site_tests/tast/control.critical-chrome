Run the Tast must-pass Chrome test suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Chrome-dependent Tast-based tests that are required to pass
against a remote DUT. It fails if any individual Tast tests fail.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
