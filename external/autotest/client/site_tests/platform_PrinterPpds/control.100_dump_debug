This is a test that for chosen 100 PPD files (from ppds_100 directory) runs
the following procedure:
1. Add an Generic printer to CUPS server (user-provided ppd file).
2. Print test PDF documents (from docs directory).
3. Check CUPS logs for any errors.
4. Extract a printing pipeline from CUPS logs and rerun it as a shell script.
5. Dump acquired outputs and logs to the directory specified in the parameter
    path_outputs.
6. Remove the printer.
When printing the PDF, the printing request sent to a printer is caught by
a fake printer. All output documents are saved on the device in the directory
specified in the parameter path_outputs. This test calculates also digests
files and saves them in the same directory.
See readme.txt for details.
