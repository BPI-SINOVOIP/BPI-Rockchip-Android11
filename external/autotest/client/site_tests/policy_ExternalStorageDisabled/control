Verify effect of ExternalStorageDisabled policy on Chrome OS behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the ExternalStorageDisabled user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior. It exercises all valid policy values across three
test cases: 'True_Block', 'NotSet_Allow', and 'False_Allow'.

This test requires some sort of external storage to be connected to the DUT to
pass. If running on a lab machine, trigger this through the
policy_ExternalStorageDisabledServer server test.
