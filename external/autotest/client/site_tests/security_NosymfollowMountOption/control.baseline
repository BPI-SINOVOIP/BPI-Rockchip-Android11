When mounting a filesystem, Linux provides no way to specify that symlink
traversal should be blocked on the given filesystem. For user-supplied
filesystems in particular (sshfs, external storage media, etc.), we wish to
block symlink traversal to prevent CrOS code (e.g. the Files app) from being
tricked into following unexpected symlinks. We have added functionality to the
chromiumos LSM to enable a "nosymfollow" option, which can be provided as part
of the mount command to ensure the kernel does not allow symlink traversal on
the filesystem. This test does not test the interaction of the chromiumos LSM
code with SELinux code. That is done in
security_NosymfollowMountOption.test_selinux_interaction

PURPOSE = """
Ensure the blocking of symlink traversal on a per-filesystem basis works as
expected.
"""
CRITERIA = """
This autotest ensures that symlink traversal is blocked on filesystems that
were mounted with the "nosymfollow" option, as well as that filesystems
mounted without that option can still traverse symlinks.
