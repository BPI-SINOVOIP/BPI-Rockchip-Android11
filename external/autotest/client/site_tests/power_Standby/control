This test measures the power draw during standby (S3).

Test uses RTC wake to transistion from S3 to S0 every sample_hours for a total
  standby time of test_hours.  The S3->S0 transistions are added to
  1. Validate battery use
  2. Guarantee that S3 was maintained (no external/false wake)
  3. Create S3->S0->S3 transistions which more closely model user's interaction.

Arguments:
  sample_hours: float, number of hours between charge use samples.
  test_hours: float, the number of hours to run the test.

Test must meet the following criteria:
  Battery must contain ~20% of its charge.
  Must be run on battery power
  sample_hours > 0.1
  test_hours > sample_hours
