When cyclic garbage collection (gc) runs finalizers that resurrect
unreachable objects, the current gc run ends, without collecting any cyclic
trash.  However, the statistics reported by ``collect()`` and
``get_stats()`` claimed that all cyclic trash found was collected, and that
the resurrected objects were collected.   Changed the stats to report that
none were collected.

OS native encoding is now used for converting between Python strings and Tcl
objects.  This allows to display, copy and paste to clipboard emoji and
other non-BMP characters.  Converting strings from Tcl to Python and back
now never fails (except MemoryError).

On timeout, regrtest no longer attempts to call ``popen.communicate()``
again: it can hang until all child processes using stdout and stderr pipes
completes. Kill the worker process and ignores its output. Change also the
faulthandler timeout of the main process from 1 minute to 5 minutes, for
Python slowest buildbots.
