Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called with a
non-empty format string. This is an effort to future-proof user code. If a
derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later adds its own
__format__, it would most likely break user code that had supplied a format
string. This will be changed to a DeprecationWarning in Python 3.3 and it
will be an error in Python 3.4.

When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any integer format
code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer using its

When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with *any* integer format
code (one of 'bBhHiIlLqQ'), struct.pack attempts to use the argument's
__int__ method to convert to an integer before packing.  It also produces a
DeprecationWarning in this case.  (In Python 2.6, the behaviour was
inconsistent: __int__ was used for some integer codes but not for others,
and the set of integer codes for which it was used differed between native
packing and standard packing.)
