ttk: Fix LabeledScale and OptionMenu destroy() method. Call the parent
destroy() method even if the used attribute doesn't exist. The
LabeledScale.destroy() method now also explicitly clears label and scale
attributes to help the garbage collector to destroy all widgets.

Py3k deprecation warning now is emitted when pickling or copying some
builtin and extension objects that don't support pickling explicitly and are
pickled incorrectly by default (like memoryview or staticmethod).  This is a
TypeError in Python 3.6.

signal.setitimer() may disable the timer when passed a tiny value.

Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(), which
is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on some
platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero interval,
therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

regrtest: Enhance regrtest and backport features from the master branch.

Add options: --coverage, --testdir, --list-tests (list test files, don't run
them), --list-cases (list test identifiers, don't run them, :issue:`30523`),
--matchfile (load a list of test filters from a text file, :issue:`30540`),
--slowest (alias to --slow).

Enhance output: add timestamp, test result, currently running tests, "Tests
result: xxx" summary with total duration, etc.

Fix reference leak hunting in regrtest, --huntrleaks: regrtest now warms up
caches, create explicitly all internal singletons which are created on
demand to prevent false positives when checking for reference leaks.
(:issue:`30675`).
