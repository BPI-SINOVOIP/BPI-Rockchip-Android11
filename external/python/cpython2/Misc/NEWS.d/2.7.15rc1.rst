A regex in fpformat was vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This regex
was a potential DOS vector (REDOS). Based on typical uses of fpformat the
risk seems low. The regex has been refactored and is now safe. Patch by

Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple security
vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity infinite loop
DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix), CVE-2016-0718 (Fix

(Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the CVE-2016-5300 (Use
