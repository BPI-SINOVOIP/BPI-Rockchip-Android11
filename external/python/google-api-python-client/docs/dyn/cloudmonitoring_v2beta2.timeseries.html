<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, metric, youngest, count=None, timespan=None, aggregator=None, labels=None, window=None, pageToken=None, oldest=None)</code>
  <pre>List the data points of the time series that match the metric and labels values and that have data points in the interval. Large responses are paginated; use the nextPageToken returned in the response to request subsequent pages of results by setting the pageToken query parameter to the value of the nextPageToken.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID to which this time series belongs. The value can be the numeric project ID or string-based project name. (required)
  metric: string, Metric names are protocol-free URLs as listed in the Supported Metrics page. For example, compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/read_ops_count. (required)
  youngest: string, End of the time interval (inclusive), which is expressed as an RFC 3339 timestamp. (required)
  count: integer, Maximum number of data points per page, which is used for pagination of results.
  timespan: string, Length of the time interval to query, which is an alternative way to declare the interval: (youngest - timespan, youngest]. The timespan and oldest parameters should not be used together. Units:  
- s: second 
- m: minute 
- h: hour 
- d: day 
- w: week  Examples: 2s, 3m, 4w. Only one unit is allowed, for example: 2w3d is not allowed; you should use 17d instead.

If neither oldest nor timespan is specified, the default time interval will be (youngest - 4 hours, youngest].
  aggregator: string, The aggregation function that will reduce the data points in each window to a single point. This parameter is only valid for non-cumulative metrics with a value type of INT64 or DOUBLE.
    Allowed values
      max - 
      mean - 
      min - 
      sum - 
  labels: string, A collection of labels for the matching time series, which are represented as:  
- key==value: key equals the value 
- key=~value: key regex matches the value 
- key!=value: key does not equal the value 
- key!~value: key regex does not match the value  For example, to list all of the time series descriptors for the region us-central1, you could specify:
label=cloud.googleapis.com%2Flocation=~us-central1.* (repeated)
  window: string, The sampling window. At most one data point will be returned for each window in the requested time interval. This parameter is only valid for non-cumulative metric types. Units:  
- m: minute 
- h: hour 
- d: day 
- w: week  Examples: 3m, 4w. Only one unit is allowed, for example: 2w3d is not allowed; you should use 17d instead.
  pageToken: string, The pagination token, which is used to page through large result sets. Set this value to the value of the nextPageToken to retrieve the next page of results.
  oldest: string, Start of the time interval (exclusive), which is expressed as an RFC 3339 timestamp. If neither oldest nor timespan is specified, the default time interval will be (youngest - 4 hours, youngest]
