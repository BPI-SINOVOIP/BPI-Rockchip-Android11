name: "fsverity-utils"
description: "This is `fsverity`, a userspace utility for fs-verity.  fs-verity is a Linux kernel feature that does transparent on-demand integrity/authenticity verification of the contents of read-only files, using a Merkle tree (hash tree) hidden after the end of the file.  The mechanism is similar to dm-verity, but implemented at the file level rather than at the block device level.  The `fsverity` utility allows you to set up fs-verity protected files."
