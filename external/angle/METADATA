description:
    "The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to "
    "seamlessly run WebGL and other OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL "
    "ES API calls to one of the hardware-supported APIs available for that "
    "platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0, 3.0 "
    "and 3.1 to Vulkan, desktop OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D "
    "11. Future plans include ES 3.2, translation to Metal and MacOS, Chrome "
    "OS, and Fuchsia support."
