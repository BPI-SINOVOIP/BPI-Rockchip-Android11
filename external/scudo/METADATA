description:
    "Scudo is a dynamic user-mode memory allocator, or heap allocator, designed "
    "to be resilient against heap-related vulnerabilities (such as heap-based "
    "buffer overflow, use after free, and double free) while maintaining "
    "performance. It provides the standard C allocation and deallocation "
    "primitives (such as malloc and free), as well as the C++ primitives (such "
    "as new and delete)."
