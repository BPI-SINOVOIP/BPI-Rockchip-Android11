/**
 * This pass moves varying fetches (and the instructions they depend on
 * into the start block.
 *
 * We need to set the (ei) "end input" flag on the last varying fetch.
 * And we want to ensure that all threads execute the instruction that
 * sets (ei).  The easiest way to ensure this is to move all varying
 * fetches into the start block.  Which is something we used to get for
 * free by using lower_all_io_to_temps=true.
 *
 * This may come at the cost of additional register usage.  OTOH setting
 * the (ei) flag earlier probably frees up more VS to run.
