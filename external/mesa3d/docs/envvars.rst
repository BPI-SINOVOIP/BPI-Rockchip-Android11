Environment Variables
=====================

Normally, no environment variables need to be set. Most of the
environment variables used by Mesa/Gallium are for debugging purposes,
but they can sometimes be useful for debugging end-user issues.

LibGL environment variables
---------------------------

``LIBGL_DEBUG``
   If defined debug information will be printed to stderr. If set to
   ``verbose`` additional information will be printed.
``LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH``
   colon-separated list of paths to search for DRI drivers
``LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT``
   if set to ``true``, forces an indirect rendering context/connection.
``LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE``
   if set to ``true``, always use software rendering
``LIBGL_NO_DRAWARRAYS``
   if set to ``true``, do not use DrawArrays GLX protocol (for
   debugging)
``LIBGL_SHOW_FPS``
   print framerate to stdout based on the number of ``glXSwapBuffers``
   calls per second.
``LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE``
   disable DRI3 if set to ``true``.

Core Mesa environment variables
-------------------------------

``MESA_NO_ASM``
   if set, disables all assembly language optimizations
``MESA_NO_MMX``
   if set, disables Intel MMX optimizations
``MESA_NO_3DNOW``
   if set, disables AMD 3DNow! optimizations
``MESA_NO_SSE``
   if set, disables Intel SSE optimizations
``MESA_NO_ERROR``
   if set to 1, error checking is disabled as per ``KHR_no_error``. This
   will result in undefined behavior for invalid use of the API, but
   can reduce CPU use for apps that are known to be error free.
``MESA_DEBUG``
   if set, error messages are printed to stderr. For example, if the
   application generates a ``GL_INVALID_ENUM`` error, a corresponding
   error message indicating where the error occurred, and possibly why,
   will be printed to stderr. For release builds, ``MESA_DEBUG``
   defaults to off (no debug output). ``MESA_DEBUG`` accepts the
   following comma-separated list of named flags, which adds extra
   behavior to just set ``MESA_DEBUG=1``:

   ``silent``
      turn off debug messages. Only useful for debug builds.
   ``flush``
      flush after each drawing command
   ``incomplete_tex``
      extra debug messages when a texture is incomplete
   ``incomplete_fbo``
      extra debug messages when a FBO is incomplete
   ``context``
      create a debug context (see ``GLX_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB``) and
      print error and performance messages to stderr (or
      ``MESA_LOG_FILE``).

``MESA_LOG_FILE``
   specifies a file name for logging all errors, warnings, etc., rather
   than stderr
``MESA_TEX_PROG``
   if set, implement conventional texture env modes with fragment
   programs (intended for developers only)
``MESA_TNL_PROG``
   if set, implement conventional vertex transformation operations with
   vertex programs (intended for developers only). Setting this variable
   automatically sets the ``MESA_TEX_PROG`` variable as well.
``MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE``
   can be used to enable/disable extensions. A value such as
   ``GL_EXT_foo -GL_EXT_bar`` will enable the ``GL_EXT_foo`` extension
   and disable the ``GL_EXT_bar`` extension.
``MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR``
   The ``GL_EXTENSIONS`` string returned by Mesa is sorted by extension
   year. If this variable is set to year X, only extensions defined on
   or before year X will be reported. This is to work-around a bug in
   some games where the extension string is copied into a fixed-size
   buffer without truncating. If the extension string is too long, the
   buffer overrun can cause the game to crash. This is a work-around for
   that.
``MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE``
   changes the value returned by ``glGetString(GL_VERSION)`` and
   possibly the GL API type.

   -  The format should be ``MAJOR.MINOR[FC|COMPAT]``
   -  ``FC`` is an optional suffix that indicates a forward compatible
      context. This is only valid for versions >= 3.0.
   -  ``COMPAT`` is an optional suffix that indicates a compatibility
      context or ``GL_ARB_compatibility`` support. This is only valid
      for versions >= 3.1.
   -  GL versions <= 3.0 are set to a compatibility (non-Core) profile
   -  GL versions = 3.1, depending on the driver, it may or may not have
      the ``ARB_compatibility`` extension enabled.
   -  GL versions >= 3.2 are set to a Core profile
   -  Examples:

      ``2.1``
         select a compatibility (non-Core) profile with GL version 2.1.
      ``3.0``
         select a compatibility (non-Core) profile with GL version 3.0.
      ``3.0FC``
         select a Core+Forward Compatible profile with GL version 3.0.
      ``3.1``
         select GL version 3.1 with ``GL_ARB_compatibility`` enabled per
         the driver default.
      ``3.1FC``
         select GL version 3.1 with forward compatibility and
         ``GL_ARB_compatibility`` disabled.
      ``3.1COMPAT``
         select GL version 3.1 with ``GL_ARB_compatibility`` enabled.
      ``X.Y``
         override GL version to X.Y without changing the profile.
      ``X.YFC``
         select a Core+Forward Compatible profile with GL version X.Y.
      ``X.YCOMPAT``
         select a Compatibility profile with GL version X.Y.

   -  Mesa may not really implement all the features of the given
      version. (for developers only)

``MESA_GLES_VERSION_OVERRIDE``
   changes the value returned by ``glGetString(GL_VERSION)`` for OpenGL
   ES.

   -  The format should be ``MAJOR.MINOR``
   -  Examples: ``2.0``, ``3.0``, ``3.1``
   -  Mesa may not really implement all the features of the given
      version. (for developers only)

``MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE``
   changes the value returned by
   ``glGetString(GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION)``. Valid values are
   integers, such as ``130``. Mesa will not really implement all the
   features of the given language version if it's higher than what's
   normally reported. (for developers only)
``MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE``
   if set to ``true``, disables the GLSL shader cache. If set to
   ``false``, enables the GLSL shader cache when it is disabled by
   default.
``MESA_GLSL_CACHE_MAX_SIZE``
   if set, determines the maximum size of the on-disk cache of compiled
   GLSL programs. Should be set to a number optionally followed by
   ``K``, ``M``, or ``G`` to specify a size in kilobytes, megabytes, or
   gigabytes. By default, gigabytes will be assumed. And if unset, a
   maximum size of 1GB will be used.

   .. note::

      A separate cache might be created for each architecture that Mesa is
      installed for on your system. For example under the default settings
      you may end up with a 1GB cache for x86_64 and another 1GB cache for
      i386.

``MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DIR``
   if set, determines the directory to be used for the on-disk cache of
   compiled GLSL programs. If this variable is not set, then the cache
   will be stored in ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mesa_shader_cache`` (if that
   variable is set), or else within ``.cache/mesa_shader_cache`` within
   the user's home directory.
``MESA_GLSL``
   :ref:`shading language compiler options <envvars>`
``MESA_NO_MINMAX_CACHE``
   when set, the minmax index cache is globally disabled.
``MESA_SHADER_CAPTURE_PATH``
   see :ref:`Capturing Shaders <capture>`
``MESA_SHADER_DUMP_PATH`` and ``MESA_SHADER_READ_PATH``
   see :ref:`Experimenting with Shader
   Replacements <replacement>`
``MESA_VK_VERSION_OVERRIDE``
   changes the Vulkan physical device version as returned in
   ``VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::apiVersion``.

   -  The format should be ``MAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH]``
   -  This will not let you force a version higher than the driver's
      instance version as advertised by ``vkEnumerateInstanceVersion``
   -  This can be very useful for debugging but some features may not be
      implemented correctly. (For developers only)
``MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE``
   chooses a different driver binary such as ``etnaviv`` or ``zink``.

NIR passes environment variables
--------------------------------

The following are only applicable for drivers that uses NIR, as they
modify the behavior for the common NIR_PASS and NIR_PASS_V macros, that
wrap calls to NIR lowering/optimizations.

``NIR_PRINT``
   If defined, the resulting NIR shader will be printed out at each
   successful NIR lowering/optimization call.

   corresponding ``INTEL_DEBUG`` flag (e.g. ``vs`` for vertex shader).
   A binary could be generated from a dumped assembly by ``i965_asm``.
   For ``INTEL_SHADER_ASM_READ_PATH`` to work it is necessary to enable
   dumping of corresponding shader stages via ``INTEL_DEBUG``.
   It is advised to use ``nocompact`` flag of ``INTEL_DEBUG`` when
   dumping and overriding shader assemblies.
   The success of assembly override would be signified by "Successfully
   overrode shader with sha1 <sha1>" in stderr replacing the original
   assembly.
