OpenCSD - An open source CoreSight(tm) Trace Decode library        {#mainpage}
===========================================================

This library provides an API suitable for the decode of ARM(r) CoreSight(tm) trace streams.

The library will decode formatted trace in three stages:

1. *Frame Deformatting* : Removal CoreSight frame formatting from individual trace streams.
2. *Packet Processing*  : Separate individual trace streams into discrete packets.
3. *Packet Decode*      : Convert the packets into fully decoded trace describing the program flow on a core.

The library is implemented in C++ with an optional "C" API.

Library Versioning
------------------

From version 0.4, library versioning will use a semantic versioning format
(per http://semver.org) of the form _Major.minor.patch_ (M.m.p).

Internal library version calls, documentation and git repository will use this format moving forwards.
Where a patch version is not quoted, or quoted as .x then comments will apply to the entire release.

Releases will be at M.m.0, with patch version incremented for bugfixes or documentation updates.

Releases will appear on the master branch in the git repository with an appropriate version tag.

CoreSight Trace Component Support.
----------------------------------

_Current Version 0.14.0_

### Current support:

- ETMv4 (v4.5 [A/R profile] v4.4 [M profile]) instruction trace - packet processing and packet decode.
- PTM   (v1.1) instruction trace - packet processing and packet decode.
- ETMv3 (v3.5) instruction trace - packet processing and packet decode.
- ETMv3 (v3.5) data trace - packet processing.
- STM   (v1.1) software trace - packet processing and packet decode.

- External Decoders - support for addition of external / custom decoders into the library.

### Support to be added:

- ITM software trace - packet processing and decode.
- ETMv3 data trace - packet decode.
- ETMv4 data trace - packet processing and decode.

Note: for ITM and STM, packet decode is combining Master+Channel+Marker+Payload packets into a single generic
output packet.


Note on the Git Repository.
---------------------------

This git repository for OpenCSD contains only source for the OpenCSD decoder library.
From version 0.4, releases appear as versioned tags on the master branch.

CoreSight kernel drivers and perf suport for CoreSight trace is maintained in the latest
upstream kernel versions.

One exception is a minor patch required for autoFDO support. 
See [autofdo.md](@ref AutoFDO).

Documentation
-------------

API Documentation is provided inline in the source header files, which use the __doxygen__ standard mark-up.
Run `doxygen` on the `./doxygen_config.dox` file located in the `./docs` directory..

    doxygen ./doxygen_config.dox

This will produce the documentation in the `./docs/html` directory. The doxygen configuration also includes
the `*.md` files as part of the documentation.

Application Programming using the Library
-----------------------------------------

See the [programmers guide](@ref prog_guide) for details on usage of the library in custom applications.
(`./docs/prog_guide/prog_guide_main.md`).


Building and Installing the Library
-----------------------------------

See [build_libs.md](@ref build_lib) in the `./docs` directory for build details.

The linux build makefile now contains options to install the library for a linux environment.


How the Library is used in Linux `perf`
---------------------------------------
The library and additional infrastructure for programming CoreSight components has been integrated 
with the standard linux perfomance analysis tool `perf`.


See [HOWTO.md](@ref howto_perf) for details.

How to use the Library, perf and Trace for AutoFDO
--------------------------------------------------
Capturing trace using perf and decoding using the library can 
generate profiles for AutoFDO.

See [autofdo.md](@ref AutoFDO) for details and scripts.

(`./tests/auto-fdo/autofdo.md`).
