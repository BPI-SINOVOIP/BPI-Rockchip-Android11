The 1.3 version of CLDR is now at at beta status, and available via
<http://unicode.org/cldr/version/1.3.html>.

The new features include addition of data for timezones, UN M.49 regions,
POSIX-format data, LDML metadata, language/script/territory mappings,
new tests, and various other fixes and additions of data, and many extensions
to the specification. A new survey tool is being used to vet the additions of data.

We encourage people to look at the data and provide feedback, especially
on the new POSIX-format data and the changes in the specification. For details
on accessing CLDR data, see <http://unicode.org/cldr/repository_access.html>. 

NOTE: Feedback should *not* be provided via the online Unicode forms; instead,
