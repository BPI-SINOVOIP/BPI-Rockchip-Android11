            <h1>Unicode CLDR Technical Committee Process</h1>



            
            
            <h2><a name="introduction"></a>1.
Introduction</h2>



            
            
            <p>This document describes the Unicode CLDR Technical
Committee, and its process for data collection, resolution, public
feedback and release. The process is designed to be light-weight: in
particular, the meetings are frequent, short, and informal. Most of the
work is by email or phone, with a database recording requested changes
in data.</p>



            
            
            <p>When gathering data for a region and language, it
is important to have multiple sources for that data to produce the most
widely acceptable data. Initial versions of data were based on the best
available sources, but CLDR data will be modified and improved, in
successive versions, by more input from the contributors inside and
outside of the Unicode Consortium.</p>



            
            
            <p>It is important to note that CLDR is a Repository,
not a Registration. That is, contributors should not expect that their
contributions will simply be adopted into the repository; instead, it
will be vetted against the best available information.</p>



            
            
            <p>All inputs are open, and gathered via the <a href="survey_tool.html">CLDR Survey Tool</a> or
recorded in a bug/feature request database (<a href="filing_bug_reports.html">CLDR Bug Reports</a>).
Changes in response to requests in the database may be entered into the
repository snapshot over time by the maintainers of the repository, but
the final approval of the release of any version of CLDR is up to the
decision of the CLDR Technical Committee.</p>



            
            
            <p>For more information on the formal procedures for
the Unicode CLDR Technical Committee, see the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html">Technical
Committee Procedures for the Unicode Consortium</a>.</p>



            
            
            <h2><a name="specification_changes"></a>2.
Specification Changes</h2>



            
            
            <p>The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/">UTS #35: Locale
Data Markup Language (LDML)</a> specification may be changed to
add structure for new kinds of data or other features. Requests for
changes are entered in the bug/feature request database (<a href="filing_bug_reports.html">CLDR Bug Reports</a>).</p>



            
            
            <p>Structural changes are always
backwards-compatible. That is, previous files will continue to work.
Deprecated elements remain and can be used, although their usage is
strongly discouraged.</p>



            
            
            <p>There is a standing policy for structural changes
that require non-trivial code for proper implementation, such as time
zone fallback or alias mechanisms. These require the existence of at
least a prototype implementation that demonstrates correct function
according to the proposed specification.</p>



            
            
            <h2><a name="data_vetting_process"></a>3.
Data Submission and Vetting Process</h2>



            
            
            <p>Once data for a country and language has been
received, the data from the different sources will be compared to show
agreements and differences. Initial data contributions are normally
marked as&nbsp;draft; this may be changed once the data is
vetted.</p>



            
            
            <p>Note that there are two types of data in the
repository:</p>



            
            
            <ol>

              <li><b>Common Data: </b>The contents
is decided upon by the CLDR Technical Committee, following its
procedures and this process.</li>

              <li><b>Comparison data: </b>The
contributor can be an individual or an organization. Data is normally
gathered by calling public APIs, to ensure that the data matches what
is actually in use. The data is only for comparison, and will not be
changed except where necessary to update the data to match the external
source. The only requirement is that all changed data be versioned, and
the Version Numbering Scheme be used.</li>

            
            </ol>



            
            
            <p>Contributors are encouraged to use local language
and country contacts, inside and outside their organization, to help
vet current common data and any new proposals for addition or amendment
of common data. In particular, national standards organizations are
encouraged to be involved in the data vetting process.</p>



            
            
            <p>For CLDR to add a new language just requires that
the proposer to commit to providing at least the minimal localization
(exemplar characters, months, days, date/time formats, translations for
a few countries, languages, currencies, etc.). <span style="font-style: italic;">The exemplar characters,
however, are required before the new locale can be added: see also <a href="filing_bug_reports.html#Exemplar_Characters">Exemplar
Character Sources</a>. </span>The new locale then becomes
available for additional translations and vetting during the next
review cycle.</p>



            
            
            <h3>3.1 <a name="resolution_procedure">Resolution
Procedure</a></h3>



            
            
            <p>The following procedure is used when resolving
differences in submitted data. At the end, for each field a single
value will be chosen as optimal, while the others will have an <i>alt=proposed</i>
attribute. The <i>draft</i> attribute on all the values
will be set to one of 4 states:</p>



            
            
            <ul>



              <li><i><span style="font-weight: 700;">unconfirmed</span></i></li>



              <li><b><i>provisional</i></b></li>



              <li><b><i>contributed (= minimally approved)</i></b></li>



              <li><i><b>approved</b>
(equivalent to an absent draft attribute)</i></li>



            
            
            </ul>



            
            
            <p>Implementations may choose the level at which they
wish to accept data. They may choose to accept even <b>unconfirmed</b>
data, especially if there is no translated alternative. Approved data
is approved by the Technical Committee, as described by the resolution
process below. This does not mean that the data is guaranteed to be
error-free -- this is simply the best judgment of the committee
according to the process.</p>



            
            
            <h4>User Levels</h4>



            
            
            <p>There are multiple levels of access and control:</p>

              <li>If data has a formal problem, it can be fixed
directly (in CVS) without going through the above process. Examples
include:
                
                
                <ul>



                  <li>syntactic problems in pattern, extra
trailing spaces, inconsistent decimals, mechanical sweeps to change
attributes, translatable characters not quoted in patterns, changing '
(punctuation mark) to curly apostrophe or s-cedilla to s-comma-below,
removing disallowed exemplar characters (non-letter, number, mark,
uppercase when there is a lowercase).</li>



                  <li>These are changed in-place, without
changing the draft status.</li>



                
                
                </ul>



              </li>



              <li>Linguistically-sensitive data should always go
through the survey tool. Examples include:
                
                
                <ul>



                  <li>names of months, territories, number
formats, changing ASCII apostrophe to U+02BC modifier letter apostrophe
or U+02BB modifier letter turned comma, or U+02BD modifier letter
reversed comma, adding/removing normal exemplar characters.</li>



                
                
                </ul>



              </li>



              <li>The TC committee can authorize bulk submissions
of new data directly (CVS), with all new data marked
draft="unconfirmed" (or other status decided by the committee), but
only where the data passes the CheckCLDR console tests.</li>



              <li>The survey tool does not currently handle all
CLDR data. For data it doesn't cover, the regular bug system is used to
submit new data or ask for revisions of this data. In particular:
                
                
                <ul>



                  <li>Collation, transforms, or text
segmentation, which are more complex.

            <p>There may be conflicting common practices or
standards for a given country and language. Thus LDML provides keyword
variants to reflect the different practices. For example, for German it
allows the distinction between PHONEBOOK and DICTIONARY collation.</p>



            
            
            <p>When there is an existing national standard for a
country that is widely accepted in practice, the goal is to follow that
standard as much as possible. Where the common practice in the country
deviates from the national standard, or if there are multiple
conflicting common practices, or options in conforming to the national
standard, or conflicting national standards, multiple variants may be
entered into the CLDR, distinguished by keyword variants or variant
locale identifiers.</p>



            
            
            <p>Where a data value is identified as following a
particular national standard (or other reference), the goal is to keep
that data aligned with that standard. There is, however, no guarantee
that data will be tagged with any or all of the national standards that
it follows.</p>



            
            
            <h3>3.4 <a name="Dot-Dot_Releases">Dot-Dot
Releases</a></h3>



            
            
            <p>Dot-dot releases, such as 1.4.1, are issued
whenever the standard identifiers change (that is, BCP 47 identifiers,
Time zone identifiers, or ISO 4217 Currency identifiers).&nbsp;
Updates to identifiers will also mean updating the English names for
those identifiers.</p>



            
            
            <p>Corrigenda may also be included in dot-dot
releases. Dot-dot releases may also be issued if there are substantive
changes to supplemental (non-language) data. An example of supplemental
data additions would be adding more transforms, or adding more
script-language info.<br>



            <br>



Normally there are no dot-dot releases for language data, but the
committee may decide to issue one if the situation warrants. Normally
there are no major changes in the specification. </p>



            
            
            <p>The structure and DTD may change, but except for
additions or for small bug fixes, data will not be changed in a way
that would affect the content of resolved data.</p>

Data Release Process</h2>

Numbering</a></h3>



            
            
            <p>The locale data is frozen per version. Once a
version is released, it is never modified. Any changes, however minor,
will mean a newer version of the locale data being released. The
versioning scheme is x.y.z, where z is incremented for bug fixes, y is
incremented for any additions (such as new locale data or LDML
elements), and x is incremented for any major changes in format.</p>

data will be issued as either alpha or beta releases, available for
public feedback. The dates for the next scheduled release will be on <a href="index.html">CLDR Project</a>.</p>
