These benchmarks are designed to be used from within a benchmark framework
like http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~mperes/ezbench/.

A typical way to run them would be:

$ ~/ezbench/ezbench.sh -p ./linux,git -m '' -b gem: -r 15

which executes the set of gem benchmarks, 15 times each, using HEAD of
./linux.git as the reference commit.
