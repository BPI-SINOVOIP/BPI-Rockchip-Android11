This directory contains test lists that are used by Intel's CI. The
files are passed to piglit with the --test-list parameter directly.

The test lists are contained in the IGT repository for several
reasons:

- The lists stay synchronized with the IGT codebase.
- Public availability. Kernel developers can see what tests are run,
  and can see what changes are done to the set, when, and why.
- Explicit test lists in general make it possible to implement a new
  test without having it run in CI (accidentally or on purpose) before
  CI is ready for it, and for CI to stop running a test without
  removing the test or changing its name. The previous method of test
  selection was based on name patterns.

Changing the test lists should only happen with approval from the CI
people. If you make a new test that should be tested by CI regularly,
ask a maintainer (see MAINTAINERS).

======================
fast-feedback.testlist
======================

Fast-feedback contains tests that roughly tests a wide coverage of
features in a short time. If the tests in fast-feedback report no
regressions, the (almost) full suite of IGT tests is executed for
proper testing. Results of a fast-feedback test round should only be
considered to mean that the kernel is not obviously broken.

The results of CI runs on drm-tip and various other kernel trees can
be found in https://intel-gfx-ci.01.org/CI/

=============
blacklist.txt
=============

This file contains regular expressions (one per line) for tests that
are not to be executed in full suite test rounds.

=============
meta.testlist
=============

Meta-testlist contains tests that are hardcoded to generate various
different test results. It is used to test CI systems for proper
result reporting, notification systems, etc.
