/* Testcase: checks whether the kernel handles mmap offset exhaustion correctly
 *
 * Currently the kernel doesn't reap the mmap offset of purged objects, albeit
 * there's nothing that prevents it ABI-wise and it helps to get out of corners
 * (because drm_mm is only 32bit on 32bit archs unfortunately.
 *
 * Note that on 64bit machines we have plenty of address space (because drm_mm
 * uses unsigned long).
