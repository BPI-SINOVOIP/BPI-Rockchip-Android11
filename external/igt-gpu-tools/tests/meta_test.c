/*
 * The purpose of this test is to test the CI system that we have
 * for running the tests. The test should generate all possible
 * exit states for igt tests.
 *
 * Possible exit-states of igt tests:
 * 1. pass - subtest: pass-result
 * 2. fail - subtest: fail-result
 * 3. dmesg warn - subtest: dmesg-pass
 *               - subtest: dmesg-warn
 *     The purpose is to check that certain kernel log activity
 *     gets correctly reported in the test result, and that normal
 *     activity doesn't.
 * 4. crash - subtest: user-crash
 * 5. piglit timeout - subtest: piglit-timeout
 * 6. incomplete - subtest: generate-panic
 *      NOTE: inorder for this to generate the incomplete state
 *      the kernel must be configured to reboot on panic.
 *      NOTE: if the tested CI system have features such as
 *      PSTORE and/or kexec/kdump enabled. This test could be
 *      used to make sure that the CI system stores the generated
 *      log/dumps as expected.
 * 7. incomplete - where user hang is not caught by piglit timeout.
 *      This would be caught by a user-side softdog daemon,
 *      such as owatch by ezbench. However, I don't know
 *      how to trigger this state, so it will not be tested.
 * 8. incomplete - system requires hard reboot :
 *      This state could be triggered by calling an evil kernel
 *      module that was developed hang the system. Such
 *      a module will not be developed for this purpose,
 *      so this "exit state" will not be tested.
 *
 * TODO: If this test was deployed on a CI system that
 * was able to pick up testing again after reboot,
 * such as ezbench, a post-analyze test should be added
 * that collected and analyzed the result of the tests
 * run before reboot.
