This directory contains test lists to be used for v3d's DRM support. The files
are passed to piglit with the --test-list parameter directly.

The test lists are contained in the IGT repository for several
reasons:

- The lists stay synchronized with the IGT codebase.
- Public availability. Kernel developers can see what tests are run,
  and can see what changes are done to the set, when, and why.
- Explicit test lists in general make it possible to implement a new
  test without having it run by everyone else before the tests and / or setup
  are ready for it.

Changing the test lists should only happen with approval from the v3d
maintainer, Eric Anholt (eric@anholt.net).

============
v3d.testlist
============

This test list is meant as a general test suite without any time
restriction for the v3d DRM driver, combining generic DRM and KMS
tests.  As a reminder, you can run this with the meson build using:

./build/runner/igt_runner --test-list tests/v3d_ci/v3d.testlist \
  build/tests -o results
