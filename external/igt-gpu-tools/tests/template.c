 * Note that test function (and code called by them) should generally not return
 * a variable indicating success/failure. Instead use the igt_require/igt_assert
 * macros to skip out of the entire subtest.
 *
 * Also, helper functions should only return a status code if the callers have a
 * real need to differentiate. If the only thing they do is call igt_assert or a
 * similar macro then it'll result in simpler code when the check is moved
 * completely into the helper.

 * Variables which are written to in igt_fixtures/subtest blocks need to be

 * havoc (since these magic blocks use setjmp/longjmp internally).

 * Common practice is to put variables used in the main test function into
 * global scope, but only right above the main function itself (to avoid leaking
