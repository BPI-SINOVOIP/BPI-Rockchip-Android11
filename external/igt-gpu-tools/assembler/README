intel-gen4asm is a program to compile an assembly language for the Intel 965
Express Chipset.  It has been used to construct programs for textured video in
the 2d driver.

Some examples of gen4 assembly programs are in the doc/examples directory.

Note that the language parsed by this assembler is not exactly what the final
language is going to look like.  In particular, the send instructions need to
be cleaned up and made more reasonable to program with.
