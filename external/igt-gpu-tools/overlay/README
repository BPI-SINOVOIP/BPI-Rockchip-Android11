This is a simple overlay showing current GPU activity. An asynchronous
overlay is used, rendered by the CPU to avoid introducing any extra work
on the GPU that we wish to monitor.

The x11-overlay backend requires xf86-video-intel 2.21.15 or later, with
SNA enabled.

As it requires access to debug information, it needs to be run as root.
