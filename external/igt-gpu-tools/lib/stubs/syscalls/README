This directory contains stub implementations for syscalls missing from libc.
This provides a way to build IGT on an old system, but it will not run
correctly if the kernel is missing the functionality provided. In order to
add a new definition, follow the same directory hierarchy as the standard
location in which the header is defined so we don't have to clutter the
codebase to support old systems.
