SYNOPSIS
========

**intel_upload_blit_large_gtt**

DESCRIPTION
===========

**intel_upload_blit_large_gtt** is a microbenchmark tool for DRM performance.
It should be run with kernel modesetting enabled, and may require root privilege
for correct operation. It does not require X to be running.

Given that it is a microbenchmark, its utility is largely for regression testing
of the kernel, and not for general conclusions on graphics performance.
