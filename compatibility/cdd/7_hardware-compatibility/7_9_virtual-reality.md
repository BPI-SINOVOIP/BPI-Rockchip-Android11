## 7.9\. Virtual Reality

Android includes APIs and facilities to build "Virtual Reality" (VR)
applications including high quality mobile VR experiences. Device
implementations MUST properly implement these APIs and behaviors,
as detailed in this section.

### 7.9.1\. Virtual Reality Mode

Android includes support for [VR Mode](
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#setVrModeEnabled%28boolean, android.content.ComponentName%29),
a feature which handles stereoscopic rendering of notifications and disables
monocular system UI components while a VR application has user focus.
