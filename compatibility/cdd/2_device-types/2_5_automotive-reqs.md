## 2.5\. Automotive Requirements

**Android Automotive implementation** refers to a vehicle head unit running
Android as an operating system for part or all of the system and/or
infotainment functionality.

Android device implementations are classified as an Automotive if they declare
the feature `android.hardware.type.automotive` or meet all the following
criteria.

*   Are embedded as part of, or pluggable to, an automotive vehicle.
*   Are using a screen in the driver's seat row as the primary display.

The additional requirements in the rest of this section are specific to Android
Automotive device implementations.

     ever or after 4+ days). The requirement [7.3.3/C-1-2](#7_3_3_gps) is
     typically met in vehicles without cellular network-based data connectivity,
     by using GNSS orbit predictions calculated on the receiver, or using the
     last known vehicle location along with the ability to dead reckon for at
     least 60 seconds with a position accuracy satisfying
     [7.3.3/C-1-3](#7_3_3_gps), or a combination of both.

Note that the "memory available to the kernel and userspace" above refers to the
memory space provided in addition to any memory already dedicated to hardware
components such as radio, video, and so on that are not under the kernelâ€™s
control on device implementations.

### 2.5.4\. Performance and Power

Automotive device implementations:

*   [[8.2](#8_2_file_i/o_access_performance)/A-0-1] MUST report the number of
bytes read and written to non-volatile storage per each process's UID so the
stats are available to developers through System API
`android.car.storagemonitoring.CarStorageMonitoringManager`. The Android Open
Source Project meets the requirement through the `uid_sys_stats` kernel module.
*   [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/A-1-3] MUST support [Garage Mode](
    https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/garage_mode).
*   [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/A] SHOULD be in Garage Mode for at least
    15 minutes after every drive unless:
    *    The battery is drained.
    *    No idle jobs are scheduled.
    *    The driver exits Garage Mode.
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-1] MUST provide a
per-component power profile that defines the [current consumption value](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html)
for each hardware component and the approximate battery drain caused by the
components over time as documented in the Android Open Source Project site.
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-2] MUST report all power
consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh).
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-3] MUST report CPU power
consumption per each process's UID. The Android Open Source Project meets the
requirement through the `uid_cputime` kernel module implementation.
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A] SHOULD be attributed to the
hardware component itself if unable to attribute hardware component power usage
to an application.
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-4] MUST make this power usage
available via the [`adb shell dumpsys batterystats`](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batterystats.html)
shell command to the app developer.

### 2.5.5\. Security Model

If Automotive device implementations support multiple users, they:

*   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-1] MUST NOT allow users to interact with
nor switch into the [Headless System User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types),
except for [device provisioning](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/provision).
*   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-2] MUST switch into a [Secondary User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types)
before [`BOOT_COMPLETED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED).
*   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-3] MUST support the ability to create
a [Guest User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types)
even when the maximum number of Users on a device has been reached.


Automotive device implementations:

*    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-1] MUST back up the keystore implementation
     with an isolated execution environment.
*    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-2] MUST have implementations of RSA, AES,
     ECDSA and HMAC cryptographic algorithms and MD5, SHA1, and SHA-2 family
     hash functions to properly support the Android Keystore system's supported
     algorithms in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on
     the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms
     by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the
     isolated environment, including DMA. The upstream Android Open Source
     Project (AOSP) meets this requirement by using the [Trusty](
     https://source.android.com/security/trusty/) implementation, but another
     ARM TrustZone-based solution or a third-party reviewed secure
     implementation of a proper hypervisor-based isolation are alternative
     options.
*    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-3] MUST perform the lock screen
     authentication in the isolated execution environment and only when
     successful, allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. Lock screen
     credentials MUST be stored in a way that allows only the isolated execution
     environment to perform lock screen authentication. The upstream Android
     Open Source Project provides the
     [Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](
     http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html)
     and Trusty, which can be used to satisfy this requirement.
*    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-4] MUST support key attestation where the
     attestation signing key is protected by secure hardware and signing is
     performed in secure hardware. The attestation signing keys MUST be shared
     across large enough number of devices to prevent the keys from being used
     as device identifiers. One way of meeting this requirement is to share the
     same attestation key unless at least 100,000 units of a given SKU are
     produced. If more than 100,000 units of an SKU are produced, a different
     key MAY be used for each 100,000 units.

Note that if a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android
version, such a device is exempted from the requirement to have a keystore
backed by an isolated execution environment and support the key attestation,
unless it declares the `android.hardware.fingerprint` feature which requires a
keystore backed by an isolated execution environment.

Automotive device implementations:

*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-1] MUST gatekeep messages
from Android framework vehicle subsystems, e.g., whitelisting permitted message
types and message sources.
*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-2] MUST watchdog against
denial of service attacks from the Android framework or third-party apps. This
guards against malicious software flooding the vehicle network with traffic,
which may lead to malfunctioning vehicle subsystems.

Automotive device implementations:

*    [**Perfetto**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/perfetto)
    *   [[6.1](#6_1_developer_tools)/A-0-1] MUST expose a `/system/bin/perfetto`
        binary to the shell user which cmdline complies with
        [the perfetto documentation](
        https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/perfetto).
    *   [[6.1](#6_1_developer_tools)/A-0-2] The perfetto binary MUST accept as
        input a protobuf config that complies with the schema defined in
        [the perfetto documentation](
        https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/perfetto).
    *   [[6.1](#6_1_developer_tools)/A-0-3] The perfetto binary MUST write as
        output a protobuf trace that complies with the schema defined in
        [the perfetto documentation](
        https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/perfetto).
    *   [[6.1](#6_1_developer_tools)/A-0-4] MUST provide, through the perfetto
        binary, at least the data sources described  in [the perfetto documentation](
        https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/perfetto).
