# bionic_app tests

These aren't the bionic tests. They're in cts/tests/tests/bionic/ (or, if
you're looking for the actual gtests rather than the CTS boilerplate, in
bionic/tests/).

This directory is just a place to test libc functions in an app context.

See also cts/tests/tests/dynamic_linker/ for some similar testing of
the dynamic linker.
