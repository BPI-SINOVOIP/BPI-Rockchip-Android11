        The CTS stubs package cannot be used as the target application here,
        since that requires many permissions to be set. Instead, specify this
        package itself as the target and include any stub activities needed.

        This test package uses the default InstrumentationTestRunner, because
        the InstrumentationCtsTestRunner is only available in the stubs
        package. That runner cannot be added to this package either, since it
        relies on hidden APIs.
