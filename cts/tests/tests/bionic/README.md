# bionic tests

This is the CTS boilerplate for the majority of the bionic tests. The
actual gtests themselves are in bionic/tests/.

See also cts/tests/tests/bionic_app for tests of libc functions in an
app or JNI context.

See also cts/tests/tests/dynamic_linker/ for some similar testing of
the dynamic linker.
