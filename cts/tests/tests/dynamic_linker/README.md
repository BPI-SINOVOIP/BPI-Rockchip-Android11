# dynamic_linker tests

These tests test the dynamic linker in an app context, using System.load and
System.loadLibrary.

See also cts/tests/tests/bionic for CTS boilerplate to run the real bionic
gtests from bionic/tests/, which includes the vast majority of dynamic linker
testing.

See also cts/tests/tests/bionic_app for tests of libc functions in an
app or JNI context.
