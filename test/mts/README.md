# Android Mainline Test Suite (MTS)

MTS consists of a set of testing frameworks and test cases, designed to help
enhance the robustness, reliability, and compliance of a mainline train (i.e. 
a set of mainline modules).

MTS has mainly three types of tests:

  * Unit tests
  * CTS tests
  * GTS tests
