    <!-- TODO: Uncomment this after the instrumentation signature issue is resolved:
     MTS runs on goog/dev-keys signed devices, but MTS is built with aosp/test-keys so
     instrumentation doesn't work properly. Solution is pending, either a short term solution
     based on adding a new MTS target in vendor/unbundled_google or something else the
     release team cooks up.
