MTS Trade Federation
---------------------

Mainline Test Suite Trade Federation, mts-tradefed for short, is built on
top of the Android Trade Federation test harness to test mainline modules.

Configuring mts-tradefed
------------------------

Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

And ensure device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using mts-tradefed
-------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the mts-tradefed console by running the 'mts-tradefed'. If you
are working from the Android source tree and have run 'm mts',
the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/ats/android-mts/tools/mts-tradefed
3. Type:
'run mts' to run the default MTS plan

Some other useful commands are

To run a test module:
'run mts --module <module_name>'

To run a specific test:
'run mts --test <test_name>'

To shard a plan test run on multiple devices
'run mts --shards <number of shards>
note: all connected devices must be running the same build

For more options:
'run mts --help'

MTS Tradefed Development
------------------------
See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run mts-tradefed from the development
environment:
cd <path to android source root>
m mts
mts-tradefed

More documentation and details on using and extending trade federation will
be forthcoming in the near future.
