VTS Trade Federation
---------------------

VTS Trade Federation, vts-tradefed for short, is the next generation test
harness for VTS.

vts-tradefed is built on top of the Android Trade Federation test harness.

It works in a similar manner to the prior VTS harness, but with much
simplicity.

  - tests all run through Trade Federation without python wrapper, thus no
virtualenv is needed.
  - supports sharding a VTS test run across multiple devices in parallel
  - supports Trade Federation suite features including auto-retry.

Configuring vts-tradefed
------------------------

1. Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

2. Follow the 'Setting up your device' steps documented in the VTS User Manual.
# TODO: add link for documentation.

3. Connect the device to the host machine.

4. Ensure device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using vts-tradefed
-------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the vts-tradefed console by running the 'vts-tradefed'. If you've
downloaded and extracted the VTS zip, the script can be found at
android-vts/tools/vts-tradefed
Or else if you are working from the Android source tree and have run `make
vts`, the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/vts/android-vts/tools/vts-tradefed
3. Type:
'run vts' to run the default VTS plan

Some other useful commands are

To run a test module:
'run vts --module <module_name>'

To run a specific test:
'run vts --module <module_name> --test <test_name>'

To shard a plan test run on multiple devices
'run vts --shard-count <number of shards>
note: all connected devices must be running the same build

For more options:
'run vts --help'

VTS Tradefed Development
------------------------
See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the VTS extensions for tradefed can be found at
<android source root>/test/vts/tools/vts-tradefed

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run vts-tradefed from the development
environment:
cd <path to android source root>
make vts
vts-tradefed

More documentation and details on using and extending trade federation will
be forthcoming in the near future.
