C-Suite Trade Federation
---------------------------

App Compatibility Test Suite Trade Federation, csuite-tradefed for short, is built on
top of the Android Trade Federation test harness to test app compatibility.

Configuring csuite-tradefed
---------------------------

Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

And ensure that the device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using csuite-tradefed
---------------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the csuite-tradefed console by running the 'csuite-tradefed'. If you
are working from the Android source tree and have run 'm csuite',
the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/csuite/android-csuite/tools/csuite-tradefed

C-Suite Tradefed Development
---------------------------

See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run csuite from the development environment:

cd <path to android source root>
make csuite
csuite-tradefed
run <plan-name>

More documentation and details on using and extending trade federation will
be forthcoming in the near future.
