Layoutlib is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Android Studio.
The goal of the library is to provide a preview of a layout in Android Studio that is very close
to its rendering on devices.

None of the com.android.* or android.* classes in layoutlib run on devices.

For more details on layoutlib building process see create/README.txt
