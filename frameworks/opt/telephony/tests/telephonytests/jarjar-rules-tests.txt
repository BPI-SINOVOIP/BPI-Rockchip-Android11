# NetworkFactory is included in telephony-common and services.net
# Rename the non-jarjared, services.net version to avoid conflicts.
# This causes two NetworkFactory classes to appear in the test package (one used
# by services-net and one by telephony-common), similarly to what happens on a
# real device, except that in the test they have different package names.
