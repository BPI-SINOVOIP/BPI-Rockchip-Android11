 * When attached to an application GL render thread, a typical usage
 * pattern is to set up the SurfaceTexture with the
 * desired options, and call updateTexImage() when a new frame is desired.
 * If a new frame is available, the texture will be updated.  If not,
 * the previous contents are retained.
 *
 * When attached to a HWUI render thread, the TextureView implementation
 * calls dequeueBuffer, which either pulls a new buffer or returns the
 * last cached buffer if BufferQueue is empty.
 * When attached to HWUI render thread, SurfaceTexture is compatible to
