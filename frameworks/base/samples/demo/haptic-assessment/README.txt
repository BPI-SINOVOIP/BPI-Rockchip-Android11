This haptic assessment sample app allows the user to play with three different
types of VibrationEffects:

1) Predefined click effect with default strength.

2) One shot vibration with 20ms duration at max amplitude.

3) Waveform vibration with 500ms duration at half amplitude, then 500ms duration
   at max amplitude. This will pass if the device supports vibration amplitude
   control, and visibly fail otherwise.
