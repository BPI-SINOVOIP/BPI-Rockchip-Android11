This test only runs on rooted / debuggable device.

The test tries to install subsets of base.{apk,dm}, split.{apk,dm} and their
corresponding .fsv_sig files (generated by build rule). If installed, the
tests also tries to tamper with the file at absolute disk offset to verify
if fs-verity is effective.
