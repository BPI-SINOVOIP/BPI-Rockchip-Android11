// This test exists only because the jni_libs list for these tests is difficult to
// maintain: the test itself only depends on libnetworkstatsfactorytestjni, but the test
// fails to load that library unless *all* the dependencies of that library are explicitly
// listed in jni_libs. This means that whenever any of the dependencies changes the test
// starts failing and breaking presubmits in frameworks/base. We cannot easily put
// FrameworksNetTests into global presubmit because they are at times flaky, but this
// test is effectively empty beyond validating that the libraries load correctly, and
// thus should be stable enough to put in global presubmit.
//
// TODO: remove this hack when there is a better solution for jni_libs that includes
// dependent libraries.
