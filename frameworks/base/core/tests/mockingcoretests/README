INTRODUCTION

The Android platform core tests that require additional mocking capabilities and use Extended
Mockito, such as the ability to stub static methods. ExtendedMockito is not fully compatible with
regular Mockito library, so tests that use it have to be verified and adapted. For that reason a
separate module is used instead of adding to FrameworksCoreTests.

For more information about ExtendedMockito see documentation of
com.android.dx.mockito.inline.extended.ExtendedMockito class.

See ../coretests/README for more information on FrameworksCoreTests.
