/**
 * A sound-trigger module.
 *
 * This interface allows a client to operate a sound-trigger device, intended for low-power
 * detection of various sound patterns, represented by a "sound model".
 *
 * Basic operation is to load a sound model (either a generic one or a "phrase" model), then
 * initiate recognition on this model. A trigger will be delivered asynchronously via a callback
 * provided by the caller earlier, when attaching to this interface.
 *
 * In additon to recognition events, this module will also produce abort events in cases where
 * recognition has been externally preempted.
