/**
 * A simple ring buffer of recyclable log messages
 *
 * The goal of this class is to enable logging that is both extremely chatty and extremely
 * lightweight. If done properly, logging a message will not result in any heap allocations or
 * string generation. Messages are only converted to strings if the log is actually dumped (usually
 * as the result of taking a bug report).
 *
 * You can dump the entire buffer at any time by running:
 *
 * ```
 * $ adb shell dumpsys activity service com.android.systemui/.SystemUIService <bufferName>
 * ```
 *
 * ...where `bufferName` is the (case-sensitive) [name] passed to the constructor.
 *
 * By default, only messages of WARN level or higher are echoed to logcat, but this can be adjusted
 * locally (usually for debugging purposes).
 *
 * To enable logcat echoing for an entire buffer:
 *
 * ```
 * $ adb shell settings put global systemui/buffer/<bufferName> <level>
 * ```
 *
 * To enable logcat echoing for a specific tag:
 *
 * ```
 * $ adb shell settings put global systemui/tag/<tag> <level>
 * ```
 *
 * In either case, `level` can be any of `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `assert`, or
 * the first letter of any of the previous.
 *
 * Buffers are provided by [LogModule].
 *
 * @param name The name of this buffer
 * @param maxLogs The maximum number of messages to keep in memory at any one time, including the
 * unused pool.
 * @param poolSize The maximum amount that the size of the buffer is allowed to flex in response to
 * sequential calls to [document] that aren't immediately followed by a matching call to [push].

     * Logs a message to the log buffer
     *
     * May also log the message to logcat if echoing is enabled for this buffer or tag.
     *
     * The actual string of the log message is not constructed until it is needed. To accomplish
     * this, logging a message is a two-step process. First, a fresh instance  of [LogMessage] is
     * obtained and is passed to the [initializer]. The initializer stores any relevant data on the
     * message's fields. The message is then inserted into the buffer where it waits until it is
     * either pushed out by newer messages or it needs to printed. If and when this latter moment
     * occurs, the [printer] function is called on the message. It reads whatever data the
     * initializer stored and converts it to a human-readable log message.
     *
     * @param tag A string of at most 23 characters, used for grouping logs into categories or
     * subjects. If this message is echoed to logcat, this will be the tag that is used.
     * @param level Which level to log the message at, both to the buffer and to logcat if it's
     * echoed. In general, a module should split most of its logs into either INFO or DEBUG level.
     * INFO level should be reserved for information that other parts of the system might care
     * about, leaving the specifics of code's day-to-day operations to DEBUG.
     * @param initializer A function that will be called immediately to store relevant data on the
     * log message. The value of `this` will be the LogMessage to be initialized.
     * @param printer A function that will be called if and when the message needs to be dumped to
     * logcat or a bug report. It should read the data stored by the initializer and convert it to
     * a human-readable string. The value of `this` will be the LogMessage to be printed.
     * **IMPORTANT:** The printer should ONLY ever reference fields on the LogMessage and NEVER any
     * variables in its enclosing scope. Otherwise, the runtime will need to allocate a new instance
     * of the printer for each call, thwarting our attempts at avoiding any sort of allocation.
