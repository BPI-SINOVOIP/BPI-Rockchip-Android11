This directory contains configuration files for lint, which is run
in as an upload hook for repo upload.

lint.xml contains checks that are turned on or off, or whitelisted /
blacklisted for particular directories, if they are different from
the default.

baseline.xml contains the list of existing "grandfathered" lint
errors in the codebase. It is generated using ./tools/lint/update_baseline.sh

When you hit a lint error that should not be triggered, there are 3
possible resolutions:
1. Use tools:ignore or @SuppressLint annotation. This is preferred
   for cases where the lint violation is intended, so that reviewers
   can review whether the suppression is appropriate.
2. Use tools/lint.xml to ignore a lint check which we don't care
   about for any file, or checks that are not actionable by the
   CL author (e.g. translation issues)
3. If there are lint errors that should be fixed, but cannot be done
   immediately for some reason, the issue should be added to
   baseline.xml.
