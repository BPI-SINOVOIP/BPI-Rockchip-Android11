NNAPI systrace parser

This tool parses systrace output generated by the NNTRACE macros and produces
timing statistics.

Usage:
parse_systrace.py <systrace html file>

Limitations:
- Output is only valid with one concurrent NNAPI client process (this could be
  done by tracing the Binder transactions from client to server)
