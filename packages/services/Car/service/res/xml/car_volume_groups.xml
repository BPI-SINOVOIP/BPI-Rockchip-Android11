<!--
  This configuration is replaced by car_audio_configuration.xml

  Notes on backward compatibility:
  If audioUseDynamicRouting is true and no car_audio_configuration.xml file
  is found in either /vendor/etc or /system/etc, then car_volume_groups.xml will
  be used and IAudioControl.getBusForContext will be queried

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Defines all of the available volume groups for volume control in a car.
  One can overlay this configuration to customize the groups.

  This configuration will be populated by CarAudioService and
  surfaced to Car Settings App and/or other volume control interfaces.

  Certain constraints applied to this configuration
    - One context should not appear in two groups
    - All contexts are assigned
    - One bus should not appear in two groups
    - All gain controllers (set on each bus) in one group have same step value

  It is fine that there are buses that do not appear in any group, those buses
  may be reserved for other purposes.

  Important note: when overlaying this configuration,
  make sure the resources are in the same package as CarAudioService.
