This module is used to create a CarDeveloperOptions module which can be accessed via Car Settings
for users who have enabled developer mode.

The module contains a lot of duplicate/dead code from the phone settings project. This will be
pruned over time to contain the minimal set of files necessary to access the developer options from
car headunits.

If the package name or module name changes, please make sure to update config.xml in the Car
Settings project in order to make sure that developer options can still be accessed via Car
Settings.
