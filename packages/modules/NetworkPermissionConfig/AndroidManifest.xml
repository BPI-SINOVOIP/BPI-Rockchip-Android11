    This package only exists to define the below permissions, and enforce that they are only
    granted to apps sharing the same signature.
    Permissions defined here are intended to be used only by the NetworkStack: both
    NetworkStack and this stub APK are to be signed with a dedicated certificate to ensure
    that, with the below permissions being signature permissions.

    This APK *must* be installed, even if the NetworkStack app is not installed, because otherwise,
    any application will be able to define this permission and the system will give that application
    full access to the network stack.
