/**
 * A transparent {@link View} that can take focus. It's used by {@link
 * com.android.car.rotary.RotaryService} to support rotary controller navigation. It's also used to
 * initialize the focus when in rotary mode.
 * <p>
 * To support the rotary controller, each {@link android.view.Window} must have a FocusParkingView
 * as the first focusable view in the view tree, and outside of all {@link FocusArea}s.
 * <p>
 * Android doesn't clear focus automatically when focus is set in another window. If we try to clear
 * focus in the previous window, Android will re-focus a view in that window, resulting in two
 * windows being focused simultaneously. Adding this view to each window can fix this issue. This
 * view is transparent and its default focus highlight is disabled, so it's invisible to the user no
 * matter whether it's focused or not. It can take focus so that RotaryService can "park" the focus
 * on it to remove the focus highlight.
 * <p>
 * If there is only one focus area in the current window, rotating the controller within the focus
 * area will cause RotaryService to move the focus around from the view on the right to the view on
 * the left or vice versa. Adding this view to each window can fix this issue. When RotaryService
 * finds out the focus target is a FocusParkingView, it will know a wrap-around is going to happen.
 * Then it will avoid the wrap-around by not moving focus.
 * <p>
 * To ensure the focus is initialized properly when there is a window change, the FocusParkingView
 * will not get focused when the framework wants to focus on it. Instead, it will try to find a
 * better focus target in the window and focus on the target. That said, the FocusParkingView can
 * still be focused in order to clear focus highlight in the window, such as when RotaryService
 * performs {@link android.view.accessibility.AccessibilityNodeInfo#ACTION_FOCUS} on the
 * FocusParkingView, or the window has lost focus.
