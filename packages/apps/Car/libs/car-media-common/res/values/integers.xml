    <!-- Defines the maximum square into which requested media items bitmaps must fit (smaller
        bitmaps are not modified, larger ones are resized to fit into the square, preserving their
        aspect ratio). A 256x256 bitmap takes 250 KB or memory, and a 512x512 takes 1 MB so this
        number should be set conservatively while making sure the displayed bitmaps look good.
        This value is also passed to media applications so they can pre-fetch their artwork at an
        optimal resolution.
